/* In the implementation , used round-robin with interrupts method.
    In the round robin while(1) loop , implemented 5 states, with state machine approach.
    In the ISR routine , have routines for TMR1, TMR0, RB4, AD converter and TMR2 interrupts.
    Moreover , divided the ISR routine to two parts, one parts is for the in game part, the other parts is for the end game part.
    Until 5 seconds passes or player guesses the special number right the ISR works wirh the in game part, after one of those conditions met, 
    , close all interrupts other then TMR1 interrupt and set it to count down for 500ms.
    In the main loop state 0 is initialization state that initializes the ISRs, and interrupt sources. (init function includes how the registers and used variables are set).
    After this state the state is changed to state 1 ready state where interrupts from TIMER0, and RB4 changes the state. 
    Whenever 50 ms passes, TMR0IF is set, and in the related interrupt routine the AD converter is started.
    After conversion finishes ADIF flag is set, and the adc_value is read in the ISR routine and the state is changed to state 2.
    In the state 2 the digit counterpart of adc_value is computed and the 7segmnet display is updated, state is changed to state 1.
    Whenever RB4 button state changes, RBIF flag is set and in the ISR TÄ±mer2 module is started. 
    The use of Timer2 is for debouncing. Timer2 count 10ms and if the RBIF flag is set before 10 ms passes, timer2 is reset to count 10 ms again. 
    If there is no change in RB4 and 10 ms passes, that means the signal is persistant and if it is a push action the state changes to state 3.
    In state 3, the guessed number and the special number is compared. If they are not equal cde leds are handled to show a hint.
    If they are equal, the state is changed to state 4. In this state, interrupts from all sources other than timer1 is disabled. And timer1 is updated to count 500ms.
    In this state if the game ended with a correct guess or 5 seconds times up is also handled. In the end of this state the cde leds are cleared and the state is changed to state 5.
    In state 5, the 7 segment display is updated with the special number and blinking of the display is handled.
    Other than correct guessing, Timer1 interrupt is used before the end game state to count 5 seconds. If 5 seconds pass, the state is also changed to state 4.
